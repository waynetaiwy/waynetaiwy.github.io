		- 布里奥妮能真正独处的时间一般是在晚上入睡前的几分钟。在黑暗中,她会沉思默想,仿佛看到自己朦胧生活在格顿女子学院。在那里,她可以读她的弥尔顿。她本来可以在姐姐曾经就读过的大学里念书,而不是在姐姐所在的医院里上班。布里奥妮以为自己正在加入到反战的洪流中,可到头来却把自己的人生和一个年长十五岁的女人绑在了一起。这位女人时时支配着她,其威力甚于一个母亲对她幼儿的掌控。

	  | ![](https://alt-649edc609ba5a.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/institution/aci_html/images_template/spacer.gif) | Another way of using other people's work is to paraphrase their words and ideas – that is, to express them in our own words or style.
	  You should paraphrase for 2 reasons:
		- the authors' words will be difficult for your reader to understand
		- for your assignments, your reader is your teacher and your teacher wants to know if you understand the author correctly.
	- You should, however, note that:
	- you cannot avoid plagiarizing by just changing a few words with synonyms while retaining the structure or style of the sentences: you must still give a citation
	- even if you have significantly changed the wording and style of the original work, you still have to acknowledge the source of information or ideas, or else it is plagiarism.
